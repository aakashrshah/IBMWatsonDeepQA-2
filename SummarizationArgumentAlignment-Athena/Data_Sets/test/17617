point : the general public will be appease : 75 of voter want the vote hold . 1 mps will fulfil their duty to represent constituent interest by call the referendum . a contented electorate will be more supportive of government and feel include in political life . not only individual but also party will be appease : the far left and right each feel strongly about this issue . euroskeptic party like ukip and the bnp have agitate for an in or out vote for year , and disguise racism and anti immigrant sentiment a euroskepticism in the process . a vote either way would settle the issue and make it hard for them to disguise antisocial aspect of their platform . pro europeans like the lib dems also want the referendum : leader nick clegg say that nothing will do more damage to the pro european movement than give room to the suspicion that we have something to hide 2 by not hold one . both side of the political spectrum want this issue definitively settle . once it have be , politician will be able to redirect focus and work on crucial issue like the economy . 
counterpoint : a good political climate be one where government function properly . in a representative democracy , decision making be not intend to be majoritarian . elected official be in place to make decision on behalf of constituent , a they continue to do with matter relate to the eu . as such , a referendum be a direct rebuke to their own power . therefore mps should not hold one , even if some constituent want it . it be not the job of government to neutralize radical voice , but to offer good alternative while preserve freedom of expression . if party want to resolve the europe question , they should do so through establish political channel . 
point : parliamentary and logistic precedent indicate that hold a referendum about an issue of sovereignty be practical and practicable . there have be two successfully hold national referendum , one the direct antecedent of this one the 1975 eec vote and one recently the 2011 av vote . the history of national referendum therefore indicate that they be both constitutional and logistically viable . furthermore , the referendum be legitimize by public desire . a bbc poll in 2009 indicate that 71 would vote 'no' to eu membership if a referendum be hold , a level of dissatisfaction which indicate the need for a public discussion and vote . 1 
counterpoint : a referendum would not be a legitimate use of government money , for it would not be practical . holding a referendum on an issue the country already approve in 1975 would be a waste of time and resource . the expense of referendum be abhorrent to the uk taxpayer ; the alternative vote referendum hold in 2011 be believe to have cost 250 million , excessive at the best of the time , irresponsible during time of financial austerity . 1 moreover , the practice of hold national referendum must be stop a it undermine parliamentary sovereignty and the parliamentary system . regarding public will , referendum be not hostage to the demand of the public , for dissatisfaction with the status quo rarely lead to or justifies a referendum . if 71 would vote no , but 83 admit they know little about the eu , then a referendum on the issue cannot be deem a legitimate representation of the united kingdom s view on eu membership . 
point : the public deserve to vote in this referendum because it regard a constitutional issue sovereignty . beyond constitutionality , referendum maintain democratic society when the public s view and mps clearly misalign , a they do in this case . this vote will also maintain the established precedent of hold referendum on eu issue . if the british people have to be consult on eec membership , a happen in 1975 , they must be consult on eu membership : the current eu barely resemble the eec that the uk vote to join long ago , but have greatly magnify stature and power . 
counterpoint : referendums be not a right . parliament have pass no law govern when referendum must be hold . because parliament have set itself no guideline on when to call referendum , the public have no right to one even if similar situation in the past have warrant them . moreover , a system of representative democracy mean referendum be not necessary it be mps' job to make decision . the public have the right to vote for leader and hold those leader accountable , not a right to vote on individual issue . 
point : a referendum , regardless of the result , will prove an effective public relation boost for the united kingdom . uk citizen will feel more confident in their government , a some currently see eu membership a an illegitimate breach of the social contract and others argue that the uk be not do enough to co operate . europeans also will improve their view of the united kingdom : a yes vote will minimize the perception of the uk a a foot dragging , reluctant participant in europe ; a no vote will be see to end a half hearted charade . either way , a more straightforward relationship with europe will minimize uk europe mistrust , which will benefit each politically and economically . 
counterpoint : a vote will make the government look weak . the government will seem like it's avoid a difficult issue by shift responsibility for the europe question to the public . europeans will see the british government a an unreliable political partner willing to gamble eu membership at a volatile and dangerous time for the continent's economic and political future . to lose the trust and co operation of europe by permit a referendum would be myopic at best , and replace long term political co operation and security with short term appeasement of the general public .
