point : israel's blockade of gaza have cause a serious humanitarian crisis . as a result of israel's action , gaza's economy be stagnant and have continue to plummet since israel restrict it movement of good and people . 1 as long a israel maintain it limitation on gaza's export and commercial production , the people of the gaza strip will remain dependent on humanitarian aid , suffer from a 50 unemployment rate where limitation on entry and exit of the area mean that chronically ill people be sometimes unable to seek outside treatment and family be torn apart . 2 education level be low , and the whole region be in a sense imprison . the un human rights council acknowledge this in 2008 and call for israel to lift the siege for humanitarian reason . 3 
counterpoint : this be simply no longer the case . a senior red cross official say this week that gaza be not suffer from a humanitarian crisis , and that the main problem instead relate to infrastructure and access to certain goods1 . israel have already dramatically ease it blockade of gaza since 2010 and now almost all consumer good be allow in . there be no shortage of food , construction project have resume , dozen of building and infrastructure project have begun2 . 
point : mounting international consensus suggest that the blockade be cruel and illegitimate . even the united states , israel's staunch ally , criticize the blockade a untenable and have urge israel to find an alternative mean of ensure it security . 1 
counterpoint : sometimes what be right be not what be popular . no matter what it do , many people and country have hat and will continue to hate israel regardless of whether or not it lift the blockade because of a complex matrix of economic , religious , cultural and political factor . lifting the blockade will not change this . 
point : israel's blockade of gaza have result in the starvation of civilian in gaza and can be see a collective punishment , both of which be illegal under international law . 1 according to richard falk , the situation be still a form of collective punishment despite the 2010 easing of the blockade2 . by restrict construction material from enter gaza , their economic recovery have stagnate and factory and construction worker remain unemployed2 . 
counterpoint : israel have every right to protect itself under international law , and this include the use of a blockade . 1 the circumstance be akin to when the united states and britain blockade japan and germany in world war ii , which be consider legal . 1 under international law , a maritime blockade be a recognize and legitimate tool that can be use during an armed conflict , which be the case between israel and gaza2 . 
point : hamas essentially have veto power over any potential peace deal between israel and the palestinians . while hamas be in power , israel need to be able to have a work relationship with it for a deal to be reach and upheld . 1 as long a israel maintain the blockade of gaza , palestinians will not trust israel in a deal , and the prospect for long term peace will remain elusive . lifting the blockade be a critical and necessary sign of good faith on israel's behalf . 
counterpoint : as long a hamas be in control of the gaza strip , there can be no lasting peace . hamas have demonstrate repeatedly over the year that it be not a trustworthy partner for peace . hamas have explicitly call for the destruction of israel . just this summer , hamas prime minister ask people to pray for the end of the state of israel . 1 the problem be not israel's blockade of gaza , it be the hamas and the hard held hatred of the people who elect hamas democratically . 
point : the blockade on gaza be originally create largely to weaken hamas , but in practice it have effectively strengthen it . since 2007 , hamas have develop a large network of tunnel and the smuggling business along the egyptian border have grow exponentially . 1 this have lead to tremendous financial gain for hamas and undermine the legitimate force in gaza's civil society . 2in term of political power , the blockade of gaza may actually serve to embolden hamas by convince the people there that israel be a bully and cannot be trust . 
counterpoint : to end the blockade without any concession from hamas can only serve to strengthen hamas , both in term of economic and political capital . it re enforces politically that hamas' immoral , hard line , terrorist tactic can succeed at achieve tactical concession from israel . it also make it easy for hamas to finance it activity by facilitate trade upon which they charge tax . this be dangerous for israel and for the world after all , hamas be the very group that condemn the capture of osama bin laden and praise him a a holy warrior . 1
