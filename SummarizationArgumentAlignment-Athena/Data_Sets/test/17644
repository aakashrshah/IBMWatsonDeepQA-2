point : a survey take in 2003 which show that english child take as much a three time longer to learn basic of the language than the european average 1 . it seem that the main problem be the fact that there be illogical inconsistency in spelling , pronunciation and meaning at a fundamental level in word that be essential in everyday use . masha bell suggest that the irregular spelling of common word like to , you , your , very , many be particularly noxious because they keep undermine the basic english spelling system and so make it hard for child to learn it . 2 if we wish to improve child literacy across the board , there would potentially be a great economic benefit in the future , a a high standard of consistency would reduce the burden on the education system and provide a more literate workforce . 
counterpoint : the language itself isn t always to blame . it be often argued that too much emphasis be place on the relationship between spell and sound , and that english can be teach more effectively use the look and say 1 method . if this be implement more widely , so that child associate the word with what it represent rather than what it sound like , then the teaching process would almost certainly accelerate . languages such a chinese and japanese which be base on symbol rather than letter rely heavily on this method of teaching , and it be this difference that often make learn their language such a challenge for europeans and americans 2 . the frequency with which word such a to , you , your , very , many be use have , accord to vivian cook , move them into the realm of signifier like register instantaneously a pound rather than word that rely on sound . because we use them so often , we be soon aware of the subtle difference and tend only to misspell them when not fully pay attention . 
point : english be the third large language in the world in term of the total number of native speaker 1 . when the people who speak english a a second language be take into account , it become by far and away the big language in the world a fact that could easily change if english isn t make easy to learn for those who be not native speaker . masha bell once more suggests that foreign learner can never be sure how to pronounce an english word without hear it first 2 , so in a period in which nation such a china and india be become more powerful economically than the like of the usa and european nation , then change to a more phonetic system would surely help maintain english a the main language of commerce . 
counterpoint : the very fact that english have be so successful show that it be not too complicate for people to learn a a second language . although specific pronunciation may take long to master in english than most other language , this do not hinder people in become literate to an acceptable standard . if anything , make the language phonetic would make thing much hard for non english speaker . other than context something which be often difficult to grasp there would be no way to tell the exact meaning of word like your you re and there their they re . 
point : research by the national literacy trust find that a key ingredient in determine future social class be language : the basic tool for thought , argument , reason and make sense of a confusing world 1 . if language be such a key part of what make up the class system , and people in general believe in equal opportunity and the eventual dissolution of that class system , then surely make the language more accessible to those who do not receive a good an education be a step in the direction of a fairer society . those from affluent background be likely to hear , speak and be teach many more word in their formative year make the language easy to learn for those who do not have this advantage be surely a good thing . 
counterpoint : that language be a key part in the intellectual development of child be not in question . at no point however , do the research suggest anything about the fundamental make up of the language have an effect on the social outcome of the child . the solution to the problem be well teach and good communication change the system to a phonetic one will not fix the fact that poor child be generally expose to few word and have less of an opportunity to learn in their formative year . 
point : 
counterpoint : changing to a 'simplified' english would actually complicate everything , a many people would continue use the more complex version , and it would still be teach . could we really expect parent who be taught one way not to pass that way on to their child ? this change would take much long than one generation and would create a mess while the change be take place .
