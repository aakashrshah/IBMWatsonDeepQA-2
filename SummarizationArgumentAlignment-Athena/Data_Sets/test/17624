point : knowing that , if they commit an offence , their name , photograph , and a description of their crime will be widely publish deters people from commit the offence in the first place and equally of reoffending . firstly , this be because there be strong moral norm prevent such behaviour ; this policy act not only to reinforce those moral norm by clearly designate people who commit such an offence a be worthy of sham , it also increase the consequence of breach such norm . specifically , potential offender will realise the harm this may cause to their personal relationship , and any future relationship these be typically thing people value , and so people will act to minimise this harm . further , if someone be willing to commit a sexual offence , it be reasonable to assume they value sexual encounter . such publication may limit their opportunity to access such encounter in the future , and therefore the policy aim to operate such a to minimise what a person desire should they commit a crime . 
counterpoint : a deterrent be unlikely to be effective give the nature of the offence concern . sexual offence be typically commit in one of two circumstance . 
point : people can use the information about the offender in their area to ensure this . it be especially useful to have a modus operandi ; if a local offender be know for typically abduct people walk on their own at night , people can alter their behaviour to ensure they always have company , or get a taxi after dark . more direct measure can be take , by avoid contact with that person , or avoid enter into a close relationship with them . furthermore , more general measure can be take to be more vigilant , install good lock , and avoid leave vulnerable people alone . some studies1 suggest that there be an increase in measure take to protect other people where this information be give . 
counterpoint : those same study suggest that individual do little extra to protect themselves , a they consider sexual offence to be suitably rare that they can plausibly tell themselves it won't happen to them . this be exacerbate by the fact that most sexual offence be commit by someone who the victim know . if they already know the person , they be likely to consider them a limited threat , a the popular perception of sexual offence be still one of an offence commit by a stranger . furthermore , people tend to be highly trust of their own impression of people . finally , the harm from never engage with former sex offender in a community be set out at opposition argument two . 
point : this policy involve an active disclosure campaign , through website and the newspaper , where a sex offender have their name , their photo , their address and the nature of their crime publish on a website , or in the local medium . it may include poster campaign about individual for particularly serious crime , with the aim of both inform people and cause shame . it may be sensible to allow the police to not disclose the information in the following circumstance ; 1 where a significant risk of vigilantism exists , 2 where it be against the wish of the victim , and 3 where it may jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation . early study show that megan's law in the united states have high rate of voluntary compliance , between 70 and 80 and rise , prove that the policy be practical1 . 
counterpoint : the option give to the police and victim to not disclose the information undermine the principled claim in proposition argument two that people should be free to determine the importance of the information on their own ; this deny them that freedom in some case . given case where there be a risk of vigilantism be the one which excite the most public feeling , these case may be the one which people feel be most important to know about . 
point : all state in some way limit individual freedom , by require them to follow law and enforce these law with the coercive power of the state . however , such limit can be justify in so far a they advance others freedom ; limit person a's freedom to kill enhances person b's freedom to live . states therefore derive their legitimacy to deny freedom from their advancement of overall freedom . this policy enhance the freedom of people to defend themselves and their family by provide them with information about offender see argument three , and allow them to determine for themselves the importance of that information1 . 
counterpoint : freedom be not an absolute good ; only something that typically advance overall utility , a we understand that people be normally well place to maximise their utility , be the only one with knowledge of their desire and value . this , however , be not such a case a the opposition argument below suggest , this cause harmful consequence that outweigh any claimed benefit of utility . furthermore , this area seem to be one where the police be well place to determine the importance of the information , give their expertise in offend and re offending , and especially give the tendency on behalf of the public to panic , and place more importance on past conviction than it factually require .
