point : there be realistic way a policy of deny healthcare access to smoker could be carry out . insurance company already ask lot of health related question , often include whether their client be a smoker , when assess life insurance premium . in these case , you be require to give detail of your lifestyle by law . of course , some people do not , however this be to be expect since no law be one hundred per cent effective . sanctions exist to discourage dishonest behaviour . a similar model could be put in place require a declaration of smoker status to the health authority . indeed , many doctor already enquire about their patients' smoking status on an informal basis . it be also particularly hard to lie about be a smoker for two reason . first , other people inevitably see you smoke . this mean an abundance of witness in the case of a dispute , and thus a disincentive to lie . second , people require doctor to undertake detailed examination for treatment purpose , thereby allow them to see obvious outward sign of smoking : tar deposit , tar in cough , yellow fingernail , etc . 
counterpoint : denying , or even reduce , access to healthcare for smoker be impractical , and therefore an unrealistic policy goal . first , the extent to which care be deny be questionable . does the proposition model include deny palliative care ? if it do , this literally mean leave people to suffer agonise pain in emergency while they try to locate private prescription painkiller , if they can afford them . further , do it include deny emergency procedure such a resuscitation in the case of a heart attack ? if it do , where be patient suppose to go ? private emergency room be few and far between , or non existent , in many country never mind private ambulance . second , in order to encourage smoker to stop smoking , the process need to involve reactivate access to healthcare if smoker quit . but any cut off point at which the right be re activate will necessarily be arbitrary . some study have suggest that , for instance , teenager do irreparable damage to their respiratory system even if they stop smoke young . if all citizen make an informed decision to smoke , a the proposition argue , isn t it the case that teenager make an informed decision to do inordinate damage to their body ? if it be , then why should there be an absolute cut off point at which one reassumes healthcare right ? should there be a relative scale ? wouldn t this be impossible to construct on a scientific basis ? 
point : smokers contribute a disproportionately large amount to the cost of healthcare . they be a drain on resource . in the uk it be estimate that up to 9 , 500 bed be block daily by smoker , and that up to eight million doctor consultation be require on their behalf each year . a well inform smoker , unable or unwilling to quit , might assume an increase risk for himself but he would also be indirectly increase the likelihood of others be unable to access necessary healthcare and this be not fair . allowing smoker to take scarce bed or organ need for transplant that could otherwise go to those suffer from genuine misfortune be an unjust allocation of resource . 
counterpoint : the added cost to public healthcare that come a a result of disease bring upon by smoking be vastly outweigh by the amount of money government around the world receive in tax on tobacco . the uk currently take around 60 of the cost of a pack of cigarette in tax duty . in 2008 , the us take over 16 billion in tobacco tax revenue1 . such high tax duty and revenue can hardly be justify if smoker be not even to get healthcare for their money . and without the tax , cigarette would be much cheap , encourage more people to smoke . moreover , because smoker tend to die early than non smoker , per head the average health care cost be low than those of non smokers2 . 1 tax policy centre , us tobacco revenue statistics , 2 2 usa today , 15 jul 11 , do smoker cost society money . . accessed 15 jul 11 . 3 
point : many people have to wait for surgery when they have fall ill or gotten injure through no fault of their own . many of the people they be wait behind have fall ill out of choice . this include smoker who have contract disease a a result of their habit . there be a vast array of information , easily available to smoker , on the danger of cigarette . if despite this , a person choose to smoke anyway then it be unfair that others who have fall ill out of genuine misfortune should have to wait in line behind them for healthcare . this problem be particularly in acute in state that have universal healthcare , where non smoker be force to wait in a queue for treatment behind those who have negligently make themselves ill smoke . in britain for example , they have attempt to avoid this by establish standard under which surgery be deny to obese patients1 . thomas condliff , the patient , be deny gastric band surgery due to have a body mass index lower than the threshold under which they believe the surgery would be effective2 . the priority in such case be and should be with those who have make a conscious decision to develop an unhealthy habit . 1 bbc news , 11 jul 11 , man appeal for nhs gastric bypass surgery . accessed 14 jul 11 . 4 2 bbc news , 11 jul 11 , man appeal for nhs gastric bypass surgery . accessed 14 jul 11 . 4 
counterpoint : many smoker do not choose to harm themselves , they simply can't help it . the 1988 us surgeon general's report on the addictive nature of cigarette smoking provide proof of what be now widely accept smoking cigarette be highly addictive . moreover , there be high correlation between people smoke and be under stress or have parent that smoke . all of this suggest that people do not necessarily choose to smoke and may not be able to choose to give up . given that smoker can therefore be portray a suffer from involuntary addiction , it would seem sensible to tackle this addiction alongside physical health issue , a oppose to dismiss smoker altogether . 
point : governments should do everything they can to discourage smoking . they already attempt to do so in a number of way , such a through ensure graphic health warning be present on all tobacco packaging . many state have also introduce legislation ban smoke indoors in an attempt to discourage the habit . however , smoking be still a massive problem million of people still do it . the refusal of medical treatment to smoker would surely be a massive deterrent to current potential smoker from continue start the habit . the safety net of modern healthcare be pull from underneath them would be a powerful incentive to give up the habit , and reduce the estimate 100 billion that the white house believe smoker cost the economy annually through loss of productivity1 . 1 usa today , 15 jul 11 , do smoker cost society money . . accessed 15 jul 11 . 3 
counterpoint : there be no evidence that limit access to healthcare would act a a deterrent . in fact , in the developing world , where a smoker would on average have bad access to healthcare , tobacco consumption have increase significantly over the last decade . 1furthermore , government have indeed act to discourage smoking through a variety of method . these have include advertising campaign and ban smoking in public place and they seem to have work . cigarette use in the developed world have decline over the last 50 year . in the uk , smoke rate have drop by half between 1974 and 2009 , from 45 down to 21 2 . a majority 59 have never take up the habit3 . 1 world health organization , the tobacco atlas , 6 2 daily telegraph , 22 jan 09 , lowest ever number of smoker after public ban and health campaign . accessed 14 jul 2011 . 7 3 daily telegraph , 22 jan 09 , lowest ever number of smoker after public ban and health campaign . accessed 14 jul 2011 . 7 
point : failure to quit smoking before surgical procedure increase cardiac and pulmonary complication , impairs tissue healing , and be associate with more infection and other complication at the surgical site . for example , in a study of wound and other complication after hip or knee surgery , no smoker who quit beforehand develop a wound infection compare with 26 of ongoing smoker and 27 of those who only reduce tobacco use . overall complication be reduce to 10 in those who quit smoke compare with 44 in those who continued1 . this mean that surgery cost more on average for smoker and be also less likely to be effective . treating more smoker mean devote more resource for low result . therefore , prioritize non smoker , at least in certain area of healthcare , would be beneficial to society a a whole . 1http peters , m . j . 2007 should smoker be refuse surgery ? british medical journal , 10 
counterpoint : smokers may have a high chance of harm from surgery due to complication arise from their habit , but this be not a phenomenon specific to them . cardiovascular disease , or heart disease to most people , be the number one killer of men and woman in the united states1 . it be cause by the build up of fatty deposit that clog the vessel those at risk be often smoker , but can just as often be those who be overweight , have diabetes or simply high blood pressure . as such , it be not justify to single out smoker when those with unhealthy diet can just a easily cause complication in their surgery .
