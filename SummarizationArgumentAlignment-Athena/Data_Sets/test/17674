point : many state in the modern world do not respect the right of minority or actively seek to dilute and subsume them into the majority culture . others offer limited protection to minority people but stop short of allow them to choose their own future . we need to reassert their right to self determination to ensure that these minority culture be not lose . failure to defend the principle of self determination now will effectively close off the choice of future generation . 
counterpoint : forcible assimilation , a in the australian case cite , be clearly wrong , but that do not mean that we should abandon the goal of integrate minority into society without forfeit their cultural , racial or religious difference . placing undue importance on the right to self determination may make such situation worse . furthermore , in some situation , government manipulate the idea of self determination to suit their own end . many government have pursue a policy of send settler from the majority race or religion into minority dominate area and then point at the difficulty of allow such area to implement political reform or secede without massive social upheaval . 
point : in some context , separation may not be a realistic option for minority people . however , that do not mean that self determination be not meaningful for such group . for indigenous people , self determination may take the form of restitution for land that be steal from them , or compensation and reparation . furthermore , self determination may take the form of political autonomy , or great right to decide how child be educate , or parallel system of justice such a sharia court . self determination be about representation and identity and choice not about outcome . 
counterpoint : the wrong of colonial power be by now far in the past . the great majority of people live in former colony , or indigenous people in country like the us or australia , have no experience of that time and have not be directly affect by the injustice of colonialism . making sure that everyone in society have equal right and opportunity be nothing to do with self determination . 
point : many modern nation state be the product of historical accident or hurry decolonisation process that do not properly take account of ethnic or religious difference between people in the state that result . examples can be see all over the world but especially in asia , africa and the former soviet union , where postcolonial or post cold war boundary separate people from their kin against their will . other territory may be dispute between one or more nation . 
counterpoint : it be true that many modern state have somewhat artificial or arbitrary boundary . however , this apply to some or other extent to all state everywhere in the world ; indeed , the nation state a we know it be a relatively modern construct , and no nation state be completely ethnically or culturally homogenous . there be certainly place in the world where minority be oppress , but insist on self determination a a universal human right often merely encourage separatism , racial tension and conflict . 
point : modern liberal democracy be found on the idea that people should be free to decide their own leader and their own future , but not all state give their minority people such a right . however , this be a right guaranteed under international law . the international court of justice have hold that this right apply not just to national government but also people1 . the two important united nations study on the right to self determination set out factor of a people that give rise to possession of right to self determination : a history of independence or self rule in an identifiable territory , a distinct culture , and a will and capability to regain self governance2 . if these criterion be in place , such people should have the right to determine their own constitutional and political arrangement . 
counterpoint : the principle of self determination might seem a straightforward one but in practice it be rarely that simple . firstly , in many country , majority and minority group live side by side , rather than in distinct territory . upholding the right of such a minority to self determination may not be possible without affect the right of the other inhabitant of that area . this damage might be direct for example , if the people of catalonia decide to secede from spain , what will happen to the spanish inhabitant of catalonia ? or it may be indirect , a in the example of palestine , whose independence have long be resist by israel on the ground that it would constitute a threat to israeli security .
