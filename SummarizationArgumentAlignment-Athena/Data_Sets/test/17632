point : this argument be build on the premise that a ban or high taxation in practice will lead to less smoker , especially protect the family of smoker and other non smoke citizen from potential health risk and premature death . 
counterpoint : first of all , a ban on smoking might just lead to people decide to turn on to the black market for tobacco , not solve the problem of passive smoking or any other effect . same also go for the possibility of high taxation , people might just choose a relocation of fund due to high price of cigarette . 
point : a ban or high restriction be a good measure to diminish the effect of smoking in society , because unlike the spreading of information which be usually do by school club , governmental restriction or a total ban will ensure the access of measure to the whole population . through a ban on advertisement or high taxation those citizen not involve in active educational structure get educate about the problem . 
counterpoint : how can it be that only tobacco company get single out and tell not to advertise their product , while many others such a prescription drug be allow to market their product ? there be many product which be hugely dangerous , take alcohol for example . whilst drink can be advertise , in the uk they must also carry a drink responsibly warn . why can tobacco company not do the same especially when you consider how much more immediate the danger from alcohol be ? 
point : there be little doubt that smoke tobacco be extremely harmful to the smoker's health . in the us , for example , research by the american cancer society suggest that tobacco cause up to 400 , 000 death each year1 more than aids , alcohol , drug abuse , car crash , murder , suicide , and fire combine . world wide some 5 million people die from smoke each year2 one every ten second which estimate suggest will rise to 10 million by 2020 . smokers be up to 22 time more likely to develop lung cancer than non smoker , and smoking can lead to a host of other health problem , include emphysema and heart disease . 
counterpoint : while a government have a responsibility to protect it population , it also have a responsibility to defend their freedom of choice . the law step in to prevent citizen cause harm to others , whether deliberately or accidentally . however , it should not stop them take risk themselves for example , dangerous sport such a rock climbing , parachute or motor racing be legal . it be also legal to indulge in other health threaten activity such a eat lot of fatty food , take no exercise , and drink too much alcohol . banning smoking would be an unmerited intrusion into personal freedom .
