counterpoint : teaching to the test happen only when school decide to test without change what and how they teach . a good teacher use their time properly will be able to teach both the skill necessary for the national test , and the 'life skills' need to be a good citizen . in the united kingdom for example , fifteen school account for around one third of place at it top university , oxford1 . this be despite the fact that all student take the same test . these good school , with the best teacher , be able to provide both the teaching require to get the best grade and the important life skill . therefore , national testing do not have to lead to teacher 'teaching to the test' . anyway , there be little to worry about ; the school day allow plenty of time for student to learn the information for test and still take part in additional activity and attend class that teach more of the life skill . 1 cook , c . 2011 , july 8 . elite school take third of oxbridge place . retrieved july 11 , 2011 , from financial times : 3 
point : using a national test to check if school and their teacher be good enough , or if student be learn fast enough , be not right . it be unfair on student , and will lead to good teacher be force out of their job , make problem bad . teachers point out that they be be judge on result , but that result be affect by other thing , like the size of class and the background of the student . a good option be to look at everything the student have do , not simply one test . instead of test a student on just one day , an assessment should use teacher report , teacher create test , and student presentation that take place over the entire school year . in other word , they should ask 'did the child's knowledge and skill grow at least one year's worth ? that be the important question , not whether this third grade score well than the previous year's third grade . '1 this would especially benefit student who be not good test taker . finland be one such example of a state that have no national testing , the government instead look at an '8 to 10 per cent sample of pupil's work to check on performance'2 . finland be the same country which have consistently be rank the world's best education system for almost all of the past decade2 . 1 mcclatchy . 2008 , december 11 . commentary : no child left behind need revision . retrieved july 8 , 2011 , from mcclatchy : 4 2 garner , r . 2011 , june 6 . are finnish school the best in the world ? retrieved july 12 , 2011 , from the independent : 5 
counterpoint : a national testing be the fair mean to judge the quality of school , teacher and student . schools and teacher know what they will be judge on at the start of each year ; they be aware of what they have to teach and if their student do not do well , they should be hold responsible for that failure . it make school and teacher answerable for what go on in the classroom . if school and teacher be do a good job , they have nothing to fear . as for student themselves , english teacher stephanie butler say 'if i don't know the weakness of my student , how can i know best to help them ? ' . 1 a national test be therefore necessary to judge student , both for the teacher , plan lesson , and the government a a whole , which take that information and use it to give funding to weak school . 1 abc news . 2007 , may 29 . report child : no child left behind . retrieved july 8 , 2011 , from abc good morning america : 6 
point : the idea of national testing may seem like a good idea until you start to actually try to agree the standard that teacher must teach to . agreeing what must be teach be difficult enough in a local setting ; nationally such agreement be probably not achievable . which historic figure should all student learn about ? what part of history be most important ? should creationism be teach in science or religious education ? maribeth wilkerson , a graduate student of education , argue 'public school be serve a particular community , so for that community to not have a say in what's taught and how doesn't seem right'1 . also , and partly a a result , good standard be difficult to come up with . standards be either too vague so that the test maker and teacher do not know what material to focus on , or they be too detail so that teacher and student be swamp by the large number of subject that must be cover . for instance , in the united states , standard be expect to improve with time , lead to fear that even if school and student improve , they will not do so quick enough to meet national expectations2 . some even fear that 'by 2014 , virtually every school across our country will have fail the unrealistic mandate of no child left behind'2 , the program that enforce national testing . 1 curtis , d . 2011 , july 11 . local educator want to take back school : will march on washington july 30 . retrieved july 12 , 2011 , from fosters : 7 2 rdf . 2011 , july 10 .

counterpoint : developing acceptable national standard be not easy , but other country have demonstrate that create a good standard of test that inspire student and teacher be possible . excellence be create by bring together the right people , examine textbook , and look at standard already put in place by many national teachers' association . in the united states , the quality of education that student receive previously depend on what state , county , and town they live in . this break the principle of equality that be a key part of the value of the country . if all teacher be aware of the expected standard their student should be attain , the quality of education for all child can go up . 
point : teachers and parent , who pay most of the school cost , either through taxation or fee , should be able to choose what be teach there . particularly in large country , school across the country be very different and should be able therefore to teach different thing . however , national testing mean that every school would have to teach the same information to their student . in the united states , each state have previously set it own curriculum set of course and test after all , they pay 90 of the cost of schooling1 . when national testing be introduce however , community be force to replace their own test method with the national test . this therefore remove the right of community to run their school a they feel be best . 1 wallis , c . , steptoe , s . 2007 , may 24 . how to fix no child left behind . retrieved july 8 , 2011 , from time 10 
counterpoint : most school already be similar , even if they don't realise it . most high school student be prepare for the same college entrance exam and so have to study what be need to do well in these test . also , only a few textbook maker produce text for high school student so most school have to teach similar course anyway . furthermore , to allow local teacher and parent to determine what be teach in their own school can only lead to a big gap between the quality of learn in one school a oppose to another . teachers and parent in rich part of the country be go to be good at create a curriculum for school child , therefore the government , to be fair , should pick the best one and make all school teach it . 
point : any system of standardized test where everyone be give the same test assume that all student learn at the same rate . but this be not the case . talented student and un talented student should not be measure by the same test . handing down a standard national test from the top be bind to end up with a one size fit all result that doesn't suit the weak or the best student . in the united kingdom , national testing be introduce in 1988 . by 2002 , 90 of student at the best school get the top grade , whilst 300 , 000 of the united kingdom's bad pupil fail to pass . the national test 'has not only become too easy for the academically able , but it be still too difficult for the bottom 40 per cent , who cry out for course to help them make sense of their last three year of compulsory school 1 . a one size fit all national test do not adequately measure the ability of the student , and fail to motivate student in their education . the best student find them too easy , the bad student find them too difficult . 
counterpoint : standardized testing be not perfect , but it help to set useful standard that help student learning . it be important that a nation have a general frame of reference on where student should , on average , be at various stage in their education . standardized testing help do this by set a baseline level of achievement at each grade , where the average student be expect to be . while some student may perform above or below this standard , the important thing be judge the general educational trend across society , so that government can help guide their national educational system onto a globally competitive path .
