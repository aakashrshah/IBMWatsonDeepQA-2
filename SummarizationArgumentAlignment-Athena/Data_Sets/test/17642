point : teachers be the most important resource in the classroom , without them student have nobody to lead them . however often teacher be poorly pay to 'manage' a classroom of poorly behave student . even though most teacher may see their work a a vocation , such pressure can cause stress and depression . the national union of teachers estimate that half of all teacher in the uk have consider leave the profession cite the above factor a the basis of this1 . this poor behaviour of the student may have a multitude of cause such a frustration that the lesson be too hard or too easy . in selective class teacher can target a certain level at the class and don't have to try to cope with a wide range of ability , thus allow the teacher to fulfil their choose vocation rather than to only discipline the student . 1 'stress of term time be put teachers' mental health at risk , say nut' 2009 access on 16 06 2011 , 2 
counterpoint : in no school can there ever be a class of identical ability , even in selective school , there be a divergence . the mark of a good teacher be in be able to juggle vary ability and differentiate the lesson appropriately . this should be an important focus in teacher training course . giving teacher an easy time be a poor way of justify such an elitist education . in any case , the problem be a relative one ; weak student within a selective school may become unmotivated and perform less well than they would have do a more able student in a mixed ability school . 
point : selective school consistently score high in league tables1 because all the student be of a similar ability the teacher can teach to that level , stretch or support them a necessary . bright child can make fast progress and study more subject at a high level . there will also be less bad behaviour a bright child won't be get bore with a slow pace , and less able student won't feel leave behind . for example , in 2006 , the pupil in england's 164 grammar selective school produce more than half the total number of a grade a level in 'harder' a level subject than those produce by pupil in up to 2 , 000 comprehensive school2 . 1 'losers in school league table face closure' polly curtis , access on 15 05 2011 5 2 'the comprehensive failure' ngsa national grammar school association , access 23 06 2011 , 6 
counterpoint : yes , the pupil in selective school get good academic result than mixed ability one because they have cream off all the bright student and exclude child who may have special educational need . however it be mislead to say that selective school have high performance . according to the 2009 pisa survey the education system with high performance and an equitable distribution of learn outcome tend to be comprehensive and in contrast , school system that assume that student have different destination with different expectation and differentiation in term of how they be place in school , class and grade often show less equitable outcome without an overall performance advantage . 1 furthermore the proposition do not take into account the 'value added' a measure of the progress student make between different stage of education by comprehensive school . students in mixed ability school improve by be in them ; whatever their ability level when they enter the school . 
point : selection create the opportunity for talented but financially unprivileged child to access academically excellent school . the majority of parent be unable to afford private education and it be unfair to condemn child to a second rate education because of their parent's earn power . this create a more mobile society in which your ability matter more than how well off your parent be . for example in northern ireland , which have a system of differentiated education consist of grammar school , secondary modern and no independent school , 42 of student from the low income group go to university , compare with only 28 from similar income group in england . 1 1'letter to david cameron' ngsa national grammar school association , access 10 08 2011 , 7 
counterpoint : for disadvantaged child to access the benefit of a grammar school require that they pass an exam in the first place , demonstrate their ability , before receive the education they so desperately need a catch 22 . the exam entry system merely keep out those who need to get through , because they won't come from privileged background that groom them for pass the entrance exam . melissa benn state that selective option within the state system tend also to benefit the middle class family ; those with the knowhow and the spare cash to negotiate the shadowy world of tutor , sunday school and school scholarship , and of course the reassuring , win manner when face a headteacher's interview for a secondary school place 1 . furthermore , well to do parent will often buy house in the catchment area of a good grammar school , and so effectively pay for education through their mortgage and in the process squeeze out low earn family the undercover economist tim harford . it be clear that disadvantage student do not have equal representation in selective school , in germany pupil be allocate to school base on their academic ability , seemingly discount any idea that pupil be select accord to their social background . however only 11 of work class child attend gymnasiums the more academic school , while the percentage of child of civil servant remain at 50 2 and in uk only 2 of the grammar school population receive free school meal , compare to the 14 national average case . the disadvantage of pupil from the low section be maintain by the education system a they be stream into the more vocational route and separate from pupil from the high section of society who be place within the academic route . 1'the 3 right to a comprehensive education ; second caroline benn memorial lecture give by prof . clyde chitty of goldsmith's college' , 16 november 2002 3 2 hans hahn , education and society in germany oxford : berg , 1998 
point : children be different and there should be different kind of school to meet their individual need and talent . children with a talent for music or sport should go to special school to help them develop their gift . less academic child need a vocational education one that give them useful skill to pre pare them for the workplace . bright child need more academic school that push them to learn and achieve as much a they can . selecting student by ability be the way to make sure we provide each one with the best type of education for them . for example in germany pupil be stream into a specific educational route at the age of 10 or 11 year old where they largely remain for the remainder of their statutory education . a mixed ability gesamtschule be introduce to pursue a common base for learn 1 but the majority of pupil enter the traditional selective system which be divide into three main type of secondary schooling . the hauptschule offer some vocational orient course as well a general subject and lead to part time enrolment in a vocational school combine with apprenticeship training until the age of 18 ; the realschule lead to part time and high vocational school and the gymnasium , base on the classical education , lead to the abitur and prepare student for university or a dual academic and vocational credential . it be possible for student with high academic achievement at the realschule to switch to a gymnasium on graduation . germany score high than the average of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd in math and literacy and have continue to improve these score over the year as well a raise the achievement of the low per form pupil pisa . 
counterpoint : children be different but they be all of equal value . with selective education brighter child be value more highly because of the attitude society have to academia , and the rest end up in much bad school . in mixed ability school all child be value equally and can learn a lot from each other . weaker student gain a lot from have more able child in their class , and bright one can be stretch by be ask to help those who need support . children be often good at some subject but weak at others so selection on ability can make little sense . such difference be best cater for by have stream within a mixed ability school . furthermore , in such a school pupil can still get individual attention base on their ability . for example , finland be almost completely comprehensive structure and the finnish ministry of education state that within this , all child be guarantee opportunity for study and self development accord to their ability . germany may score above average but country such a finland consistently score 1st or 2nd in reading and math pisa whilst retain a comprehensive system of education .
