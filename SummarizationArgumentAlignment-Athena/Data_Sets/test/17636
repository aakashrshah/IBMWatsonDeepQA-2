point : teachers be there to help child learn , not to be their friend . while teacher can maintain a convivial atmosphere in the classroom , have access to corporal punishment be simply an extra weapon in the arsenal of learning tool available to teacher , give them great control over the classroom and their student , an essential part of the teaching environment1 . when the teacher do not control the classroom , teaching be difficult , or impossible . studies show that teacher , parent , and most student agree that discipline be an essential part of classroom order2 . in a gallup poll in 2002 76 of the public thought that discipline in us schools be a very or somewhat serious problem . 3 if the teacher be busy deal with unruly child , and thus force to divert from the lesson plan , there be less time to devote to actually teach the student who want to learn . for the sake of students' future they must be bring to heal , by the threat and application of force when necessary . 1 bbc news . 2000 . should corporal punishment return to the classroom ? . 1 2 bowen , sherry . 2010 . discipline in schools : what works and what doesn't . a href a href eduguide . 2 3 gallup , alec m . , rose , lowell c . , 2002 , the 34th annual phi delta kappa gallup poll of the public's attitudes toward the public schools , gallup , 3 
counterpoint : discipline be not to be laud at all time over enjoyment in the classroom . children's mind must be treat with great care and the teacher must earn the respect of his student through capable teaching , not just the threat of force . students who fear the lash will be less likely to develop to their full academic potential , for fear that show up the teacher might result in punishment . in order to grow and push mental boundary , student must feel free and safe to ask difficult question . corporal punishment create a confrontational relationship between student and teacher , in which such mental development be hamper . 
point : in term of conflict resolution , without access to corporal punishment , the teacher student relationship be at an imperfect equilibrium in the context of game theory1 . in this scenario , the two player , the teacher and the student , have a set of option . the teacher , when make a threat , can either follow through on the threat and enact corporal punishment , or he can not do so . the student can either consider the threat to be credible and will thus modify his behaviour in accordance with the teacher's demand , or he can determine the threat to be non credible and thus call his bluff . without the ability to follow through on the threat , an imperfect equilibrium be reach in which the teacher's bluff be call and his authority undermine . with the ability to make good on the threat , however , the teacher can either effectively intimidate potential miscreant or deliver on the promise of punishment . this produce an efficient equilibrium in which the teacher have great control over the class . to take an example from international relation , the relation between the united states and israel can be analyze in this way2 . currently , when israel make a decision to expand settlement building in palestinian territory the united states threaten a withdrawal of certain support . israel can either call their bluff or fold . currently , because israel do not consider the united states' threat to be credible , it persist in it operation unabated . thus this situation be an imperfect equilibrium . were the united states to actually make good on it threat , israel would be force to suffer the punishment if they persist in their activity , incentivizing them instead to be cooperative . from the international stage to the classroom , conflict resolution play out in much the same way . 1 myerson , roger . 1997 . game theory : analysis of conflict . cambridge : harvard university press . 2 gates , jeff . 2009 . how israel wages game theory warfare . foreign policy journal . 4 
counterpoint : simple conflict analysis may be able to explain some facet of classroom life , but it be a gross oversimplification of the dynamic of a real life school . there be many factor drive student interaction with teacher , from problem at home to internal popularity contest between student . corporal punishment create serious psychological harm that be not account for effectively under a conflict resolution model . 
point : it be often the case in classroom environment that the vast majority of student be eager , to various extent , to learn . disruption almost always originate with one or a few student who act up for attention or to cause problem . corporal punishment deal effectively with these unruly individual who make learn more difficult and school time less productive for the rest of the class . without effective disciplinary mechanism , these troublemaker impose cost on all of their classmate . by introduce corporal punishment , troublesome student be force to internalize the cost , disincentivizing similar behavior in future1 . it be deeply unfair to the rest of the class that the teacher's time and effort be sap by deal with uncooperative student at the expense of more interested classmate . application of corporal punishment demonstrate a dedication to the right to education , which should not be disrupt by unruly individual seek to undermine the authority of the teacher . 1 bbc news . 2000 . should corporal punishment return to the classroom ? . 1 
counterpoint : targeting troublemaker will likely not stop their bad behavior . proponents of corporal punishment do not show proper regard for the reason behind students' act out . often class clown and troublemaker come from unstable or abusive home where violence be already employ , often with great liberality than would be consider acceptable in school . thus employ further violence in the form of corporal punishment will do little to modify the behavior of these student and will likely turn them away from seek the help of teacher , who might otherwise have be approach regard problem at home . 
point : generating a natural respect for authority be a necessary priority of the state , and thus of education whose purpose be to prepare young people to be effective member of the state1 . to do this it be necessary to maintain the threat of , and to have the capacity to make recourse to , corporal punishment . there be nothing wrong with student have a bit of fear with regard to teacher , just a it be right to have a healthy fear of the state , insofar a transgression of the law will be meet by serious repercussion . coddling child and limit the level of punishment that can be level against them too strictly do not prepare them for the real world in which infraction of the law have serious consequence . it be this lack of respect that be often blame for increase crime , estelle morris , then uk education secretary in 2002 blame a cycle of disrespect between school and home that lead to crime . 2 the existence of scholastic corporal punishment hammer this reality home at an early age and good acclimates child for their future a adult member of society . 1 bloom , scott . 1995 . spare the rod , spoil the child ? a legal framework for recent corporal punishment proposals . golden gate university law review . 2 bbc news , 2002 , bad parent 'causes child crime' , 7 
counterpoint : the learning environment be most beneficial to student when they feel safe in it . when student be force to keep up their guard and to fear the pain of discipline , they become less forthcoming in the classroom and be less likely to develop the life long love of learn the holistic system of primary and secondary education employ in north america and europe seek to engender 1 . additionally , student will internalize the painful experience of the classroom , which will bleed into their interaction with the state in the future , result in more confrontational attitude toward the state and it institution .
