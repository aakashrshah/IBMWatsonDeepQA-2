point : nuclear weapon be the most destructive weapon ever create , it be right that they should be limit ; something that the test ban treaty will be a step towards . an internationally ratified comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt on the testing of nuclear weapon would serve to hamper attempt by country currently not in possession of nuclear weapon from acquire them1 . of course , a country could still develop a nuclear weapon without test , but little faith can be put in a weapon that be entirely untested ; all country that currently possess nuclear weapon conduct test . a comprehensive and internationally ratify treaty against test would serve a an important signaling device to country consider develop nuclear weapon . just a a taboo have form around the use of nuclear weapon due to international accord denounce their use , so too would a ban on test generate a norm against it . countries rely on their reputation in international relation ; state will fear loss of credibility should they be see flout the ban , either by test weapon themselves or by supply material to country seek to perform test . furthermore , fear of sanction by other country and the united nations will prevent state from engage in nuclear test for fear of economic and political damage incur there from . 1 united nations general assembly . 1996 . comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty . united nations . available : 3 
counterpoint : international law be often worth little more than the paper it be write on . if country want to develop and test nuclear weapon , they will do so irrespective of a ban . not many country want nuclear weapon at all , and those that do be often not the friendly player in the international arena . in north korea , for example , the government care little for international accord and have make a habit of ignore sanction against it . a ban will have no effect on stop a state developing and test nuclear weapon if it feel it need them . 
point : scanning and detection technology have become so advanced in recent year that it be virtually impossible for a country to detonate a nuclear device without it be detect . compliance with the treaty can be monitor through the mean of seismology , hydroacoustics , infrasound , and radionuclide monitoring . the technology be use to monitor the underground , the water and the atmosphere for any sign of a nuclear explosion . the monitoring network consist of 337 facility locate across the world . the system be so sensitive that it be able to detect the disintegration of the space shuttle columbia . furthermore , the treaty's system of inspection will reveal any suspicious activity regard test . 1 clearly , efficacy in term of determine who might be test weapon be not an issue . when country be find to be violate the ctbt , heavy political and economic sanction can be impose which will serve to force country back into compliance with the treaty . 1 united nations general assembly . 1996 . comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty . united nations . available : 5 
counterpoint : there be still a great deal of speculation on the ability of the detector to spot nuclear test occur , particularly in underground facility . if such test be shield , then the treaty can be flout without fear of discovery . regardless , even if it be true that test can be detect with relative ease , the threat of sanction be not as powerful a it proponent suppose . rather , many country be perfectly willing to endure heavy sanction without acquiesce to international demand . such have be the case in both iran and north korea , which have pursue their nuclear ambition with little regard to the will of the international community . the ctbt , no matter how vocally defend , will not shape the behavior of state that want nuclear weapon . 
point : some country have be reticent to sign the ctbt for fear it would limit their ability to either expand or to begin their nuclear arsenal . the united states stand a one of the only such non signer , in the company of such country a iran , china , and north korea . the united states fear the limiting of the ability for it to defend itself with nuclear armament . however , in reality the united states will benefit politically and militarily by sign , and the world will be benefit by a great chance for peace without nuclear proliferation1 . american accession would benefit the us politically by increase it credibility a a responsible international player with a respect for international law . often the us be view by the rest of the world a a cowboy pursue it own aim and only pay lip service to the international community's opinion . if the us be to show a degree of respect to international law , particularly through sign ctbt , it will be more able to gain support from other country for it goal . also , if the us sign , it will encourage other state to sign , such a china , which have say that it signature be contingent upon that of the us . us involvement in the ctbt , and the chinese involvement expect to follow from it , will give the treaty far great weight , and will generate great obedience toward it , a country recognize that it be bind on all state , not just the weak . furthermore , from a military standpoint , the us have nothing to lose from sign a it may still retain it present nuclear stockpile , as well a to develop new delivery and guidance system , provide they be not test with live nuclear warhead . also , it have much to gain , a the ratification of the treaty will prevent other state from develop nuclear weapon , keep the club of nuclear power small and influential . clearly , it be in the interest of the united states to sign the treaty , in order to benefit not only itself , but also the international community . 1 shah , anup . 2009 . nuclear weapons . global issues . available : http : www . globaliss ues . org issue 67 nuclear weapon 9 
counterpoint : the united states bend the knee to the ctbt would do nothing to stop the country currently seek to develop nuclear weapon from do so . those country have often make a habit of ignore international sanction , and the participation of the us will do little to change their behavior with regard to nuclear armament . countries often develop nuclear weapon due to local strategic concern that be largely unaffected by the us's acquiescence to international law or otherwise . in the case of israel , for example , it choice to sign the treaty will depend entirely on iran's attitude toward develop nuclear weapon . furthermore , it may not be in the us's strategic interest to sign the treaty , a allow itself to be see a bound by international law might be perceive a a sign of weakness by potential rival . 
point : nuclear weapon test release vast quantity of radiation into the atmosphere , contaminate water supply , soil , and harm human , plant , and animal health irreparably . the bomb test conduct by the united states between 1951 and 1963 , for example , release 148 time the radioactivity of the chernobyl disaster1 . radioactivity release by russian test in the 1950s and 1960s be estimate to have release even great amount of radiation . it be estimate that 2 . 4 million people currently live will die due to cancer cause by radioactivity generate by nuclear testing . the genetic damage create by nuclear test have kill , and will kill many innocent people . accidents can also occur , a in the united states when an accident in 1954 saw inhabitant of town near a test site blanket in the radioactive plume . such horror cannot be allow to continue , but would be all the more likely in poorer country try to test weapon . furthermore , nuclear testing have do untold damage to the environment and ecosystems around the world . in the pacific , for example , hydrogen bomb test destroyed whole ecology . even when test underground nuclear weapon be dangerous to the environment , with radiation seep out of test site at half of all such tests2 . it be imperative that the environmentally devastating effect of these weapon not be allow to continue through test . 1 costandina , titus . 2001 . bombs in the backyard : atomic testing and american politics . reno : university of nevada press . 2 foster , john . 2009 . the ecological revolution : making peace with the planet . new york : monthly review press . 
counterpoint : every country have a right to self defense , which include access to a nuclear deterrent . if advanced country be concern about nuclear test they could provide the technology to bud nuclear power so that they can be safer in their construction and testing of nuclear weapon . furthermore , the damage supposedly cause by nuclear fallout be not so great a to deny the fundamental right to self defense . some ecosystem may be damage and some area may suffer high radiation level , but it will not be so bad a to significantly reduce the quality of life of people within the country conduct nuclear test or that of their neighbour . 
point : a ban on nuclear testing be almost universally desire in virtually every country , with the exception of a few rogue state , such a north korea . even in the united states , which have be reticent to sign , the popular opinion be overwhelmingly in favor of the ban1 . there be a very strong political impetus to enact a ban , and actually do so would show that the international community could actually agree upon something . it be difficult to make the case that international cooperation will accomplish anything regard contentious issue when it cannot even act on one that have universal support virtually everywhere . a ratification of the ban could thus restore faith in the ability of the international community to accomplish important goal . 1 center for arms control and non proliferation . 2011 . key reasons for a comprehensive test ban treaty . available : 11 
counterpoint : the vast majority of people may support a ban , but that will not stop rogue state from develop and test nuclear weapon any more than sign the ctbt will . the ban might gain praise from people around the world , but the actual effect to how country behave would be minimal . furthermore , there be a potential harm in sign the treaty , in that people might actually believe that the ratification of ctbt accomplish something , and would suppose that country seek nuclear weapon would actually be deter from do so . this could dampen political will to stand up to these state directly , a dangerous possibility if those rogue state do not stop their program .
