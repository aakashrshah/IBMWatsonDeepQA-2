point : citizens should be protect by individual government , however if government be either partake in or fail to prevent genocide and mass atrocity , then another global actor need to take action . the united nations should take on this responsibility to protect people when their government be unable or unwilling to do so , in order to prevent mass killing , genocide and other atrocity 1 . if we believe human right have any meaning at all , then they must be universal and therefore our obligation to protect citizen from such horror must apply regardless of state boundary . moving from a situation where the un place the right of state above those of their people , to one where individual right be give the great priority be surely morally essential . 
counterpoint : there be a procedural contradiction in the proposition's position . if there be a universal responsibility to protect , why must this only be exercise through the united nations , dependent upon security council recognition of a crisis and support for action ? the united states believe that in some case it would be right for individual state , or coalition of the willing to take action to protect innocent life elsewhere in the world , even if the security council refuse to deliver on it promise . under the proposition , nato's intervention in kosovo in 1998 99 be wrong , and so be vietnam's in cambodia against the khmer rouge , tanzania's in uganda to stop idi amin's bloodshed , etc . none of these have security council support . 
point : governments and leader who be consider attack on their own people , or who be waver in their commitment to defend them from harm , will be aware that ignore their own obligation could bring swift action from the international community . only once their ability to hide behind claim to absolute sovereignty have be remove will human right have to be take seriously by dictator and extremist regime . thus by adopt a strong un position on the responsibility to protect , we can hope to make state take their own responsibility more seriously and make the need for any actual intervention rare . for example , omar al bashir of the sudan have commit horrible atrocity against his own people . he be complicit in commit genocide against darfur population , yet remain in power . there be a warrant for his arrest from the international criminal court , but they have little ability to act upon their threat 1 . a strong commitment to the responsibility to protect would ensure leader like bashir think twice before permit such atrocity to take place , through fear for their own grip on power . 
counterpoint : an apparently strong un obligation to intervene in order to protect innocent will not necessarily provide a positive , deterrent effect . rather , it could merely serve a an incentive for dictator and general to commit their atrocity quicker . for example , when the united nations first consider intervention in libya , colonel qaddafi respond by strengthen the crackdown on protestors and prepare for an all out assault on the eastern town of benghazi 1 . the intent to protect civilian in this case serve only to increase the will of the leader to harm them . furthermore , many of the nasty or fail regime who might be fearful of intervention have a security council patron whom they can rely upon to prevent any action be take against them . if the un have an obligation to act to prevent atrocity such a genocide , then veto will be use to prevent the security council recognize that such a situation exist in the first place . though it have recently join un resolution on sudan , china block move to impose sanction on sudan before 2007 , largely due to favorable economic tie with the state 2 . finally , this proposal may make atrocity more likely , by encourage rebel group to provoke ill disciplined government force into commit gross human right violation , such a massacre , in the hope that such a response will draw in international force on their own side . 
point : we can no longer argue that sovereignty must be consider absolute . sovereignty be create a the mean by which state justify the control of their territory to prevent foreign aggression . since the creation of the united nations , sovereignty be no longer a necessary to protect state , a most war be not about territorial acquisition . now it be primarily a barrier to the international community intervene when the state be abuse it own population . a good principle be if government today be unable or unwilling to perform the duty to protect their people from harm include state impose harm , then their claim to sovereignty lose their moral force and intervention becomes justify 1 . for example , qaddafi of libya be liken his citizen to cockroach and rat , threaten to kill them house by house whilst speaking of his intent to indiscriminately attack the population of benghazi 2 . as such , there be significant concern that violence would have devastate impact on libyan civilian . the united nations , in response , authorize nato action 3 . through unleashing state military asset to attack his own population , qaddafi make it clear that he be not a fit leader . the united nations , a the representative of the international community , have the responsibility to protect those whose leader have let them down . 
counterpoint : that create a slippery slope . when do the un draw the line that a government have revoke it sovereignty ? how many people have to die ? how can it be justify that only if x number of people die , then we will intervene ? additionally , as soon a the un get involve in a civil war or dictatorship and have deem the government no longer sovereign , then who be in charge ? is the un go to set up a new government and country in the aftermath ? that be a large commitment that such a large organization may not be able to execute no matter how ideal . 
point : it be immoral to let people die when something can be do about it . it inherently value the life of victim of genocide and civil war less than other life . the world and the united nations have for too long stood by and watched atrocity unfold . cambodia , bosnia , rwanda and darfur be all horrible example where genocide and other appalling violation of human right be inflict upon civilian population while the un fail to act 1 . clearly in all the past case where action might have save life and deliver hundred of thousand of people from evil , no action be take by the security council . therefore those who argue that future challenge should be consider purely on a case by case basis must accept that this be likely to mean yet more refusal to act decisively and so more needless suffering . we must place an obligation to act on the security council so that they be predispose to respond seriously and swiftly in future . if there be a known atrocity go on in the international community , the security council should no longer be allow to ignore it base on their individual tie . for example china could not defend the sudan even though they have close financial tie when intervention for human right abuse be the norm 2 . the world respond to the holocaust say never again , yet similar ethnic cleansing have happen over and over again , and in defense of human right the un need to adopt a no tolerance policy . countries who be not prepare for this obligation should step down from the security council . 
counterpoint : not all crisis can be deal with militarily . often an invasion only create more problem . further be the un ready to take on the underlie problem in case of genocide and civil war . those rift may take decade to heal and be the un truly invest because simply provide aid and military support will not solve the deep seated tension in country like the sudan and somalia 1 . talk of prevention and of use non military mean to ensure state protect their own people properly be little different from exist un commitment . the un have fail in the past to head off humanitarian crisis and there be nothing in the new declarations to make it more likely to be successful in future . if the responsibility to protect mean anything , it be to weaken the concept of sovereignty and make military intervention more likely .
