point : the united nations be a voluntary body and reflect global reality , include the role of the usa a the dominant superpower . without the consent of the usa , the un can achieve nothing , and active us opposition to the un could destroy the organisation along with all it potential for good . it be well for the un to accept us demand for budgetary restraint and reform than to provoke the usa by unrealistic demand into withdraw from it council . this mean that the un should reflect the view of the united states a a result policy of the united nations should be base on three fundamental question : are we advance the american interest ? are we upholding american value ? are we be responsible towards for the american taxpayer dollar ? according to josh rogin unfortunately , right now , the answer to all three question be no . 1 
counterpoint : this sound rather like an ultimatum to the un if you don t like what we give you and complain we win t give you anything . the question here be that the un really do need more money in order to give the necessary assistance to country , which strive for basic thing like food , water , protection we be here today on behalf of people the world have all too often forget : the weak , the disadvantaged , those suffer the effect of climate change , violence , disaster and disease , mr . ban tell those gather in geneva for the programme kick off for the appeal . 1 the whole concept of the organization be to provide help ; however , of course , this help cannot come for free it have a certain cost . the un general secretary should not constantly ask and appeal for funding , this be not his job , although it happen all too frequently . 
point : the united states have make a significant investment in the institution . not only be it a founder , but it play host to the body in new york and make the large contribution of any nation each year . the debate over whether the united nations will continue to overcharge american taxpayer be over and the u . s . wind up on the losing end . in a dramatic turnaround from steady decline since 2001 , the percentage that the u . s . will be charge for u . n . peacekeeping have be sharply increase for the next three year , and u . s . taxpayer will end up pay roughly 100 million more each year than they would have if the 2009 assessment rate have be maintain . 1 this be not act responsibly in a time where americans be feel the pinch from the economic downturn . american taxpayer recognize that their society face a great many problem that could be address with the dollar that be annually spend on the un . while americans be generally supportive of the institution , they have a right to know that their investment be use appropriately and pays dividend in good policy . 
counterpoint : un money be spend responsiblyof course the american taxpayers' money should not be spend promiscuously , but that's not the case . the united nations spend the money it get on solve global problem and help the needy , both of which be useful to the united states a it be a role the us would otherwise have to perform . furthermore international organization such a the un be highly advantageous to the us and it population . sarah margon and john norris argue withholding fund from the united nations would fail to reap significant saving , make it more difficult for our nation to lead , and seriously undermine our high foreign policy and national security priority restrict u . s . support for the united nations ultimately have a much high price tag than it do saving a do so substantially decrease our political legitimacy while cost america money and job . 1 
point : un reform have be a major objective of the united states , and government leader assert that six year of no growth budget and pressure from the united states have result in reform of the general assembly , budget preparation procedure , the creation of sunset provision for un program and improvement in staff security . it be argue that these reform could not have be accomplish without the carrot and stick approach of the no growth policy . the un have a budget in the billion of dollar which it can spend more efficiently if it set goal and priority , evaluate outcome and eliminate waste and corruption . this have already be prove in 1996 1997 although this budget be not as lean a my government originally propose , it be perhaps the most austere ever adopt by the general assembly , the united states representative say . the budget include a number of significant reform measure and mark another in a series of significant step towards a more effective , efficient and accountable united nations , he declare , call the organization unique and indispensable . 1 
counterpoint : no growth budget actually undermine fiscal accountability and discipline . while the usa have hold the line on growth , it and other nation have simultaneously ask for the un to do more in area such a peacekeeping and nation building . as the demand on the un grow , and the budget do not grow with it , un administrator be force to move money around the budget to pay for basic overhead even electric bill and cover shortfall in one program or another . thus the basic goal setting and accountability the us strives for be undermine . for example there have be complaint about take money from the peacekeeping fund . the united kingdom have object resolution 50 218 on the working capital fund do not give the secretary general a blank cheque to fund the deficit of major contributor through enforced borrowing from peace keep account . borrowing from peace keep fund to finance the regular budget be unacceptable , and if a memberstate go so far a to refuse to pay the accumulation of more arrears could only increase the financial risk to the organization . cuba also felt that the spirit that guide the founder of the un have not be reflect in the new budget . instead , it have respond to the hegemonic and political interest of the major contributor and could be the first in a series of measure lead , in essence , not to the reform but to the destruction of the un . 1
