point : airport security have be an atrocious display of racial profiling . security officer have systematically subject arabs and other ethnic group to more severe security measure , while let caucasian traveler pass by hardly check . this sort of racial profiling and lax security need to stop and full body scanner be the way forward . by subject everyone to the scanner , which take scarcely more than 20 second 1 , security would increase by check the people that some human security official might deem low risk and decrease the offense of that same security official s stereotypical selection of certain ethnic group . 
counterpoint : precisely that be the problem the full body scanner will exacerbate . they will subject million of passenger to privacy violation who have pass baggage screening and metal detector . they will have practically naked picture of them take and store on server , which be undue violation of privacy . as far a racial profiling be concern , there be cultural concern on the other side a well . some culture do not allow opposite sex member to see each other naked , and full body scanner would force both security official and passenger to violate that . security be not justification enough , especially not when the efficiency of the scanner be questionable enough . 
point : full body scan have the ability to protect countless people and save just a many life . fighting against a threat as big a terrorism , some right need to take a backbench . privacy be good , but outweigh in this case by the need to save life . as jon adler of the federal law enforcement officers association tell the washington post in january of 2009 : i think a bomb detonate on a plane be the big invasion of privacy a person can experience . 1 additionally , people who still feel that their privacy be infringe upon by the full body scanner can always opt for the traditional pat down by a security officer . in any case , some sort of check must occur . 
counterpoint : giving security personnel the choice to submit whomever they want to a full body scan which reveal their naked body be outrageous . while some sort of protection and security be necessary , the full body scanner go beyond the limit of security and venture into pornography . philip bradbourn , a british politician , say in 2009 : the technology have the potential to turn a legitimate security concern into an unacceptable peepshow for security industry . 1 
point : screening technology with name like millimeter wave and backscatter x ray 5 1 can show the contour of the body and reveal foreign object . such machine , properly use , be a leap ahead of the metal detector use in most airport , and supporter say they be necessary to keep up with the plan of potential terrorist . argue the new york times after the detroit christmas bombing . 2 what this mean be that the full body scanner have the ability to detect hidden weapon , which be not necessarily large enough to be notice otherwise , or metallic , to be see by metal detector . as the former homeland security secretary , michael chertoff state , you need to find some way to find those weapon . 3 full body scanner come in here . 
counterpoint : the full body scanner be not nearly as effective a their proponent argue . the advanced imaging technology have limit the backscatter ray can be obscure by body part or thin object may not even be notice when the image appear . objects hide within bodily cavity also escape detection . while official say the scanner perform as well a physical pat down in operational test , it remain unclear whether the ait would have detect the weapon use in the december 2009 incident , the government accountability office state . 1
