point : consumers benefit from grey import . the economics of grey importation drive source to low cost economy . even if retailer take some of this benefit a improved profit margin , typically at least some of it will be pass on to consumer in the form of reduced price . grey import also allow consumer to buy product that may not yet be available in their own market , because they have not yet be release , or because in their market the manufacturer feel there be insufficient demand . thus , grey import expand consumer choice . 
counterpoint : consumers do not really benefit overall from grey import . although manufacturer may reduce price in some typically , rich country , they be at least as likely to raise price in less developed economy , deprive consumer there of access to international brand and luxury good , and so deprive them of a real choice and in some case the full product . 1 in addition , they will still have to pay all the tax and the loss from lack of regulation which have be avoid in some way or lose the service those tax provide . the loss of revenue from grey import can mean that production be limit or even halt go forward , even though there be market demand for more product from the manufacturer . the film industry show this clearly . manufacturer protection of their product for example region specific dvd's and pcs actually increase cost for all consumer . 
point : allowing grey import mean that manufacturer do not concentrate economic power in a monopolistic way which can be damage to free trade even adam smith1 believe certain monopoly be antithetical to free trade . banning them be tantamount to grant a licensed monopoly or cartel on a country by country basis , which inevitably mean high price for consumer . as manufacturing have increasingly be relocate into a small number of offshore country , rather than in the country of purchase , it make sense that other part of the supply chain should make a similar move so that they too can realise the efficiency benefit of a globalised economy . 
counterpoint : grey import limit a company's control over it own product . many manufacturer distributor wish to control their distribution outlet for sound commercial reason , for example , to protect the image of their brand . this become very difficult , possibly impossible , to do if grey import be allow , a this circumvent their planned distribution network . it become much harder for a manufacturer distributor to track their product where they have be use in a grey importation . this can lessen their effectiveness when they need this information , such a for a safety recall . it be unclear whether adequate mechanism be in place to adequately recall parallel trade medicine . batch number recording be not consistently apply throughout the supply chain and in practice may make comprehensive product recall difficult , create a risk to patient safety . 1 
point : governments might as well accept that allow retailer to sell grey good have benefit because government will never be able to completely prevent such import . government regulation may prevent most retailer from sell grey good but it won't stop all . for example tesco in the uk sell cut price levi jeans for year , and fought levi strauss in the court for four year to try and keep sell them . 1 if even the big retailer be willing to sell grey good unless stop by the court many small one will be get through the net . moreover consumer will simply buy the good elsewhere , particularly online . the government should instead legalise the import of grey good so that it can make sure that these import be of a high standard and do not break any other standard 
counterpoint : it may be impossible to completely stop such import however the vast majority of shop will not import these item while they be not allow to . opening the market up will simply lead to a flood of import with a result effect on native manufacturing . 
point : 
counterpoint : free trade involve a principle of free will . the buyer should be able to decide to whom he wish to sell and on what term , and if the seller do not accept those term then the buyer should be able to refuse to deal with him . manufacturers can have many good reason for choose to price good at different level in different country , such a their wish to build a long term brand preference by cheap initial marketing in a develop economy , or their desire to maintain an aura of exclusivity in mature market through high pricing and confine sale to specialist retailer . grey import result in the manufacturer distributor effectively lose some , and often most , control of their pricing and retailing strategy in the importing country . this reduce their capacity to position the brand a they see appropriate . in extremis , a company can be put out of business in one nation by it own operation overseas !
