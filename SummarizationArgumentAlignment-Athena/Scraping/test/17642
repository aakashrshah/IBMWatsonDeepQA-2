Point:Teachers are the most important resource in the classroom, without them students have nobody to lead them. However often teachers are poorly paid to 'manage' a classroom of poorly behaved students. Even though most teachers may see their work as a vocation, such pressures can cause stress and depression. The National Union of Teachers estimates that half of all teachers in the UK have considered leaving the profession citing the above factors as the basis of this1. This poor behaviour of the students may have a multitude of causes such as frustration that the lesson is too hard or too easy. In selective classes teachers can target a certain level at the class and don't have to try to cope with a wide range of abilities, thus allowing the teacher to fulfil their chosen vocation rather than to only discipline the students. 1 'Stress of term time is putting teachers' mental health at risk, says NUT' (2009) accessed on 16/06/2011, [2]
Counterpoint:In no school can there ever be a class of identical ability, even in selective schools, there is a divergence. The mark of a good teacher is in being able to juggle varying abilities and differentiate the lesson appropriately. This should be an important focus in teacher training courses. Giving teachers an easy time is a poor way of justifying such an elitist education. In any case, the problem is a relative one; weaker students within a selective school may become unmotivated and perform less well than they would have done as more able students in a mixed-ability school.
Point:Selective schools consistently score higher in league tables1 because all the students are of a similar ability the teacher can teach to that level, stretching or supporting them as necessary. Bright children can make faster progress and study more subjects at a higher level. There will also be less bad behaviour as bright children won't be getting bored with a slow pace, and less able students won't feel left behind. For example, in 2006, the pupils in England's 164 grammar (selective) schools produced more than half the total number of A grade A-levels in 'harder' A-level subjects than those produced by pupils in up to 2,000 comprehensive school2. 1 'Losers in school league tables face closure' Polly Curtis, accessed on 15/05/2011 [5] 2 'The Comprehensive Failure' NGSA (National Grammar School Association), accessed 23/06/2011, [6]
Counterpoint:Yes, the pupils in selective schools get better academic results than mixed-ability ones because they have creamed off all the brightest students and exclude children who may have special educational needs. However it is misleading to say that selective schools have higher performance. According to the 2009 PISA survey the education systems with "high performance and an equitable distribution of learning outcomes tend to be comprehensive" and "in contrast, school systems that assume that students have different destinations with different expectations and differentiation in terms of how they are placed in schools, classes and grades often show less equitable outcomes without an overall performance advantage."[1] Furthermore the proposition does not take into account the 'value added' (a measure of the progress students make between different stages of education) by comprehensive schools. Students in mixed-ability schools improve by being in them; whatever their ability level when they enter the school.
Point:Selection creates the opportunity for talented but financially unprivileged children to access academically excellent schools. The majority of parents are unable to afford private education and it is unfair to condemn children to a second rate education because of their parent's earning power. This creates a more mobile society in which your ability matters more than how well-off your parents are. For example in Northern Ireland, which has a system of differentiated education consisting of grammar schools, secondary moderns and no independent schools, 42% of students from the lower income groups go to university, compared with only 28% from similar income groups in England.1 1'Letter to David Cameron' NGSA (National Grammar School Association), accessed 10/08/2011, [7]
Counterpoint:For disadvantaged children to access the benefits of a grammar school requires that they pass an exam in the first place, demonstrating their ability, before receiving the education they so desperately need - a catch-22. The exam entry system merely keeps out those who need to get through, because they won't come from privileged backgrounds that groom them for passing the entrance exam. Melissa Benn states that "selective options within the state system tend also to benefit the middle class families; those with the knowhow and the spare cash to negotiate the shadowy world of tutors, Sunday schools and school scholarships, and of course the reassuring, winning manner when facing a headteacher's interview for a secondary school place"1. Furthermore, well-to-do parents will often buy houses in the catchment area of a good grammar school, and so effectively pay for education through their mortgage and in the process squeeze out low-earning families (The Undercover Economist- Tim Harford). It is clear that disadvantaged students do not have equal representation in selective schools, in Germany pupils are allocated to schools based on their academic abilities, seemingly discounting any idea that pupils are selected according to their social background. However only 11% of working class children attend Gymnasiums (the more academic schools), while the percentage of children of civil servants remains at 50%2 and in UK only 2% of the Grammar school population receive free school meals, compared to the 14% national average (CASE). The disadvantages of pupils from the lower sections are maintained by the education system as they are streamed into the more vocational routes and separated from pupils from the higher sections of society who are placed within the academic route. 1'The [3] Right to a Comprehensive Education; Second Caroline Benn Memorial Lecture given by Prof.Clyde Chitty of Goldsmith's College', 16 November 2002 [3] 2 Hans Hahn, Education and Society in Germany (Oxford: Berg, 1998)
Point:Children are different and there should be different kinds of schools to meet their individual needs and talents. Children with a talent for music or sport should go to special schools to help them develop their gifts. Less academic children need a vocational education – one that gives them useful skills to pre-pare them for the workplace. Bright children need more academic schools that push them to learn and achieve as much as they can. Selecting students by ability is the way to make sure we provide each one with the best type of education for them. For example in Germany pupils are streamed into a specific educational route at the age of 10 or 11 year olds where they largely remain for the remainder of their statutory education. A mixed-ability Gesamtschule was introduced “to pursue a common base for learning”1 but the majority of pupils enter the traditional selective system which is divided into three main types of secondary schooling. The Hauptschule offers some vocational-oriented courses as well as general subjects and leads to part-time enrolment in a vocational school combined with apprenticeship training until the age of 18; The Realschule leads to part-time and higher vocational schools and the Gymnasium, based on the classical education, leads to the Abitur and prepares students for university or a dual academic and vocational credential. It is possible for students with high academic achievement at the Realschule to switch to a Gymnasium on graduation. Germany scores higher than the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in maths and literacy and has continued to improve these scores over the years as well as raising the achievement of the lowest per-forming pupils (PISA).
Counterpoint:Children are different but they are all of equal value. With selective education brighter children are valued more highly because of the attitude society has to academia, and the rest end up in much worse schools. In mixed ability schools all children are valued equally and can learn a lot from each other. Weaker students gain a lot from having more able children in their class, and brighter ones can be stretched by being asked to help those who need support. Children are often good at some subjects but weaker at others so selection on ability can make little sense. Such differences are best catered for by having streaming within a mixed-ability school. Furthermore, in such a school pupils can still get individual attention based on their ability. For example, Finland is almost completely comprehensive structure and the Finnish Ministry of Education states that within this, "all children are guaranteed opportunities for study and self-development according to their abilities". Germany may score above average but countries such as Finland consistently score 1st or 2nd in reading and maths (PISA) whilst retaining a comprehensive system of education.
