Point:Airport security has been an atrocious display of racial profiling. Security officers have systematically subjected Arabs and other ethnic groups to more severe security measures, while letting Caucasian travelers pass by hardly checked. This sort of racial profiling and lax security need to stop and full-body scanners are the way forward. By subjecting everyone to the scanner, which takes scarcely more than 20 seconds[1], security would increase by checking the people that some human security official might deem “low risk” and decrease the offense of that same security official’s stereotypical selection of certain ethnic groups.
Counterpoint:Precisely that is the problem the full-body scanners will exacerbate. They will subject millions of passengers to privacy violation who have passed baggage screenings and metal detectors. They will have practically naked pictures of them taken and stored on servers, which is undue violation of privacy. As far as racial profiling is concerned, there are cultural concerns on the other side as well. Some cultures do not allow opposite sex members to see each other naked, and full body scanners would force both security official and passenger to violate that. Security is not justification enough, especially not when the efficiency of the scanners is questionable enough.
Point:Full-body scans have the ability to protect countless people and save just as many lives. Fighting against a threat as big as terrorism, some rights need to take a backbench. Privacy is good, but outweighed in this case by the need to save lives. As Jon Adler of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association told The Washington Post in January of 2009: "I think a bomb detonating on a plane is the biggest invasion of privacy a person can experience."[1] Additionally, people who still feel that their privacy is infringed upon by the full-body scanner can always opt for the traditional pat-down by a security officer. In any case, some sort of check must occur.
Counterpoint:Giving security personnel the choice to submit whomever they want to a full-body scan which reveals their naked body is outrageous. While some sort of protection and security is necessary, the full-body scanner goes beyond the limits of security and ventures into pornography. Philip Bradbourn, a British politician, said in 2009: "[The] technology has the potential to turn a legitimate security concern into an unacceptable peepshow for security industries."[1]
Point:“Screening technologies with names like millimeter-wave and backscatter X-ray [5][1] can show the contours of the body and reveal foreign objects. Such machines, properly used, are a leap ahead of the metal detectors used in most airports, and supporters say they are necessary to keep up with the plans of potential terrorists.” argued the New York Times after the Detroit Christmas bombing.[2] What this means is that the full-body scanners have the ability to detect hidden weapons, which are not necessarily large enough to be noticed otherwise, or metallic, to be seen by metal detectors. As the former homeland security secretary, Michael Chertoff states, you need to find some way to find those weapons.[3] Full-body scanners come in here.
Counterpoint:The full-body scanners are not nearly as effective as their proponents argue. The advanced imaging technology has limits – the backscatter rays can be obscured by body parts or thin objects may not even be noticed when the images appear. Objects hidden within bodily cavities also escape detection. "While officials said [the scanners] performed as well as physical pat downs in operational tests, it remains unclear whether the AIT would have detected the weapon used in the December 2009 incident," the Government Accountability Office states.[1]
