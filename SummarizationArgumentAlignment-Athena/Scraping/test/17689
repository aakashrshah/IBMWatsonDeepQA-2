Point:
Counterpoint:"Teaching to the test" happens only when schools decide to test without changing what and how they teach. A good teacher using their time properly will be able to teach both the skills necessary for the national test, and the 'life skills' needed to be a good citizen. In the United Kingdom for example, fifteen schools account for around one third of places at its top university, Oxford1.This is despite the fact that all students take the same tests. These good schools, with the best teachers, are able to provide both the teaching required to get the best grades and the important life skills. Therefore, national testing does not have to lead to teachers 'teaching to the test'. Anyway, there is little to worry about; the school day allows plenty of time for students to learn the information for tests and still take part in additional activities and attend classes that teach more of the life skills. 1 Cook, C.

Point:Using a national test to check if schools and their teachers are good enough, or if students are learning fast enough, is not right. It is unfair on students, and will lead to good teachers being forced out of their jobs, making problems worse. Teachers point out that they are being judged on results, but that results are affected by other things, like the size of classes and the background of the student. A better option is to look at everything the student has done, not simply one test. Instead of testing a student on just one day, an assessment should use teacher reports, teacher-created tests, and student presentations that take place over the entire school year. In other words, they should ask 'did the child's knowledge and skills grow at least one year's worth? That is the important question, not whether this third grade scores better than the previous year's third grade.'1 This would especially benefit students who are not good test takers. Finland is one such example of a state that has no national testing, the government instead looks at an '8 to 10 per cent sample of pupil's work to check on performance'2. Finland is the same country which has consistently been ranked the world's best education system for almost all of the past decade2. 1 McClatchy. (2008, December 11).

Counterpoint:A national testing is the fairest means to judge the quality of schools, teachers and students. Schools and teachers know what they will be judged on at the start of each year; they are aware of what they have to teach and if their students do not do well, they should be held responsible for that failure. It make schools and teachers answerable for what goes on in the classroom. If schools and teachers are doing a good job, they have nothing to fear. As for students themselves, English teacher Stephanie Butler says 'If I don't know the weaknesses of my students, how can I know best to help them?'.1 A national test is therefore necessary to judge students, both for the teachers, planning lessons, and the government as a whole, which takes that information and uses it to give funding to weaker schools. 1 ABC News.

Point:The idea of national testing may seem like a good idea until you start to actually try to agree the standards that teachers must teach to. Agreeing what must be taught is difficult enough in a local setting; nationally such agreement is probably not achievable. Which historic figures should all students learn about? What parts of history are most important? Should creationism be taught in science or religious education? Maribeth Wilkerson, a graduate student of education, argues 'public schools are serving a particular community, so for that community to not have a say in what's taught and how doesn't seem right'1. Also, and partly as a result, good standards are difficult to come up with. Standards are either too vague so that the test-makers and teachers do not know what material to focus on, or they are too detailed so that teachers and students are swamped by the large number of subjects that must be covered. For instance, in the United States, standards are expected to improve with time, leading to fears that even if schools and students improve, they will not do so quick enough to meet national expectations2. Some even fear that 'by 2014, virtually every school across our country will have failed the unrealistic mandates of No Child Left Behind'2, the program that enforces national testing. 1 Curtis, D.

Counterpoint:Developing acceptable national standards is not easy, but other countries have demonstrated that creating a good standard of tests that inspire students and teachers is possible. Excellence is created by bringing together the right people, examining textbooks, and looking at standards already put in place by many national teachers' associations. In the United States, the quality of education that students receive previously depended on what state, county, and town they live in. This broke the principle of equality that is a key part of the values of the country. If all teachers are aware of the expected standards their students should be attaining, the quality of education for all children can go up.
Point:Teachers and parents, who pay most of the school costs, either through taxation or fees, should be able to choose what is taught there. Particularly in large countries, schools across the country are very different and should be able therefore to teach different things. However, national testing means that every school would have to teach the same information to their students. In the United States, each state has previously set its own curriculum (set of courses) and tests - after all, they pay 90% of the costs of schooling1. When national testing was introduced however, communities were forced to replace their own testing methods with the national test. This therefore removes the right of communities to run their schools as they feel is best. 1 Wallis, C., & Steptoe, S. (2007, May 24). How to fix No Child Left Behind.

Counterpoint:Most schools already are similar, even if they don't realise it. Most high school students are preparing for the same college entrance exams and so have to study what is needed to do well in these tests. Also, only a few textbook makers produce texts for high school students so most schools having to teach similar courses anyway. Furthermore, to allow local teachers and parents to determine what is taught in their own schools can only lead to a big gap between the quality of learning in one school as opposed to another. Teachers and parents in rich parts of the country are going to be better at creating a curriculum for school-children, therefore the government, to be fair, should pick the best one and make all schools teach it.
Point:Any system of standardized testing (where everyone is given the same test) assumes that all students learn at the same rate. But this is not the case. Talented students and un-talented students should not be measured by the same test. Handing down a standard national test from the top is bound to end up with a "one-size-fits-all" result that doesn't suit the weakest or the best students. In the United Kingdom, national testing was introduced in 1988. By 2002, 90% of students at the best schools got the top grade, whilst 300,000 of the United Kingdom's worst pupils failed to pass. The national test 'has not only become too easy for the academically able, but it is still too difficult for the bottom 40 per cent, who cry out for… courses to help them make sense of their last three years of compulsory schooling’[1]. A ‘one-size-fits-all’ national test does not adequately measure the ability of the student, and fails to motivate students in their education. The best students find them too easy, the worst students find them too difficult.
Counterpoint:Standardized testing is not perfect, but it helps to sets useful standards that help student learning. It is important that a nation has a general frame of reference on where students should, on average, be at various stages in their education. Standardized testing helps do this by setting a baseline level of achievement at each grade, where the average student is expected to be. While some students may perform above or below this standard, the important thing is judging the general educational trends across society, so that governments can help guide their national educational system onto a globally competitive path.
