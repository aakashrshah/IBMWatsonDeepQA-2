Point:Israel's blockade of Gaza has caused a serious humanitarian crisis. As a result of Israel's actions, Gaza's economy is stagnant and has continued to plummet since Israel restricted its movement of goods and people.1 As long as Israel maintains its limitations on Gaza's exports and commercial production, the people of the Gaza strip will remain dependent on humanitarian aid, suffering from a 50% unemployment rate where limitations on entry and exit of the area means that chronically ill people are sometimes unable to seek outside treatment and families are torn apart.2 Education levels are low, and the whole region is in a sense imprisoned. The UN Human Rights Council acknowledged this in 2008 and called for Israel to lift the siege for humanitarian reasons.3
Counterpoint:This is simply no longer the case. A senior Red Cross official said this week that Gaza is not suffering from a humanitarian crisis, and that the main problems instead relate to infrastructure and access to certain goods1. Israel has already dramatically eased its blockade of Gaza (since 2010) and now almost all consumer goods are allowed in.There is no shortage of food, construction projects have resumed, dozens of building and infrastructure projects have begun2.
Point:Mounting international consensus suggests that the blockade is cruel and illegitimate. Even the United States, Israel's staunchest ally, criticized the blockade as untenable and has urged Israel to find an alternative means of ensuring its security.1
Counterpoint:Sometimes what is right is not what is popular.No matter what it does, many people and countries have hated and will continue to hate Israel regardless of whether or not it lifts the blockade because of a complex matrix of economic, religious, cultural and political factors. Lifting the blockade will not change this.
Point:Israel's blockade of Gaza has resulted in the starvation of civilians in Gaza and can be seen as collective punishment, both of which are illegal under international law.1 According to Richard Falk, the situation is still a form of collective punishment despite the 2010 easing of the blockade2. By restricting construction materials from entering Gaza, their economic recovery has stagnated and factory and construction workers remain unemployed2.
Counterpoint:Israel has every right to protect itself under international law, and this includes the use of a blockade.1 The circumstances are akin to when the United States and Britain blockaded Japan and Germany in World War II, which was considered legal.1 Under international law, a maritime blockade is a recognized and legitimate tool that can be used during an armed conflict, which is the case between Israel and Gaza2.
Point:Hamas essentially has veto power over any potential peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. While Hamas is in power, Israel needs to be able to have a working relationship with it for a deal to be reached and upheld.1 As long as Israel maintains the blockade of Gaza, Palestinians will not trust Israel in a deal, and the prospects for long term peace will remain elusive. Lifting the blockade is a critical and necessary sign of good faith on Israel's behalf.
Counterpoint:As long as Hamas is in control of the Gaza strip, there can be no lasting peace. Hamas has demonstrated repeatedly over the years that it is not a trustworthy partner for peace. Hamas has explicitly called for the destruction of Israel. Just this summer, Hamas Prime Minister asked people to pray for the end of the state of Israel.1 The problem is not Israel's blockade of Gaza, it is the Hamas and the hard-held hatred of the people who elected Hamas democratically.
Point:The blockade on Gaza was originally created largely to weaken Hamas, but in practice it has effectively strengthened it. Since 2007, Hamas has developed a large network of tunnels and the smuggling business along the Egyptian border has grown exponentially.1 This had led to tremendous financial gain for Hamas and undermines the legitimate forces in Gaza's civil society.2In terms of political power, the blockade of Gaza may actually serve to embolden Hamas by convincing the people there that Israel is a bully and cannot be trusted.
Counterpoint:To end the blockade without any concessions from Hamas can only serve to strengthen Hamas, both in terms of economic and political capital. It re-enforces politically that Hamas' immoral, hard-line, terrorist tactics can succeed at achieving tactical concessions from Israel. It also makes it easier for Hamas to finance its activities by facilitating trade upon which they charge taxes. This is dangerous for Israel and for the world- after all, Hamas is the very group that condemned the capture of Osama Bin Laden and praised him as a holy warrior.1
