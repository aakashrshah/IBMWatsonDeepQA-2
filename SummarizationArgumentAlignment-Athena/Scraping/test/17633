Point:Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons ever created, it is right that they should be limited; something that the test ban treaty will be a step towards. An internationally ratified Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) on the testing of nuclear weapons would serve to hamper attempts by countries currently not in possession of nuclear weapons from acquiring them1. Of course, a country could still develop a nuclear weapon without testing, but little faith can be put in a weapon that is entirely untested; all countries that currently possess nuclear weapons conducted tests. A comprehensive and internationally ratified treaty against testing would serve as an important signaling device to countries considering developing nuclear weapons. Just as a taboo has formed around the use of nuclear weapons due to international accords denouncing their use, so too would a ban on testing generate a norm against it. Countries rely on their reputations in international relations; states will fear loss of credibility should they be seen flouting the ban, either by testing weapons themselves or by supplying materials to countries seeking to perform tests. Furthermore, fear of sanction by other countries and the United Nations will prevent states from engaging in nuclear tests for fear of economic and political damage incurred there from.1 United Nations General Assembly. 1996. "Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty". United Nations. Available: [3]
Counterpoint:International law is often worth little more than the paper it is written on. If countries want to develop and test nuclear weapons, they will do so irrespective of a ban. Not many countries want nuclear weapons at all, and those that do are often not the friendliest players in the international arena. In North Korea, for example, the government cares little for international accords and has made a habit of ignoring sanctions against it. A ban will have no effect on stopping a state developing and testing nuclear weapons if it feels it needs them.
Point:Scanning and detection technology has become so advanced in recent years that it is virtually impossible for a country to detonate a nuclear device without it being detected. Compliance with the treaty can be monitored through the means of seismology, hydroacoustics, infrasound, and radionuclide monitoring. The technologies are used to monitor the underground, the waters and the atmosphere for any sign of a nuclear explosion. The monitoring network consists of 337 facilities located across the world. The system is so sensitive that it was able to detect the disintegration of the space shuttle Columbia. Furthermore, the treaty's system of inspection will reveal any suspicious activity regarding testing.1 Clearly, efficacy in terms of determining who might be testing weapons is not an issue. When countries are found to be violating the CTBT, heavy political and economic sanctions can be imposed which will serve to force countries back into compliance with the treaty.1 United Nations General Assembly. 1996. "Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty".United Nations. Available: [5]
Counterpoint:There is still a great deal of speculation on the ability of the detectors to spot nuclear tests occurring, particularly in underground facilities. If such tests are shielded, then the treaty can be flouted without fear of discovery. Regardless, even if it is true that tests can be detected with relative ease, the threat of sanctions is not as powerful as its proponents suppose. Rather, many countries are perfectly willing to endure heavy sanctions without acquiescing to international demands. Such has been the case in both Iran and North Korea, which have pursued their nuclear ambitions with little regard to the will of the international community. The CTBT, no matter how vocally defended, will not shape the behavior of states that want nuclear weapons.
Point:Some countries have been reticent to sign the CTBT for fear it would limit their ability to either expand or to begin their nuclear arsenals. The United States stands as one of the only such non-signers, in the company of such countries as Iran, China, and North Korea. The United States fears the limiting of the ability for it to defend itself with nuclear armament. However, in reality the United States will benefit politically and militarily by signing, and the world will be benefited by a greater chance for peace without nuclear proliferation1. American accession would benefit the US politically by increasing its credibility as a responsible international player with a respect for international law. Often the US is viewed by the rest of the world as a cowboy pursuing its own aims and only paying lip service to the international community's opinion. If the US were to show a degree of respect to international law, particularly through signing CTBT, it will be more able to gain support from other countries for its goals. Also, if the US signs, it will encourage other states to sign, such as China, which has said that its signature is contingent upon that of the US. US involvement in the CTBT, and the Chinese involvement expected to follow from it, will give the treaty far greater weight, and will generate greater obedience toward it, as countries recognize that it is binding on all states, not just the weak. Furthermore, from a military standpoint, the US has nothing to lose from signing as it may still retain its present nuclear stockpiles, as well as to develop new delivery and guidance systems, provided they are not tested with live nuclear warheads. Also, it has much to gain, as the ratification of the treaty will prevent other states from developing nuclear weapons, keeping the club of nuclear powers small and influential. Clearly, it is in the interest of the United States to sign the treaty, in order to benefit not only itself, but also the international community.1 Shah, Anup. 2009. "Nuclear Weapons". Global Issues. Available: http://www.globaliss ues.org/issue/67/nuclear-weapons [9]
Counterpoint:The United States bending the knee to the CTBT would do nothing to stop the countries currently seeking to develop nuclear weapons from doing so. Those countries have often made a habit of ignoring international sanctions, and the participation of the US will do little to change their behavior with regard to nuclear armament. Countries often develop nuclear weapons due to local strategic concerns that are largely unaffected by the US's acquiescence to international law or otherwise. In the case of Israel, for example, its choice to sign the treaty will depend entirely on Iran's attitude toward developing nuclear weapons. Furthermore, it may not be in the US's strategic interest to sign the treaty, as allowing itself to be seen as bound by international law might be perceived as a sign of weakness by potential rivals.
Point:Nuclear weapons tests release vast quantities of radiation into the atmosphere, contaminating water supplies, soil, and harming human, plant, and animal health irreparably. The bomb tests conducted by the United States between 1951 and 1963, for example, released 148 times the radioactivity of the Chernobyl disaster1. Radioactivity released by Russian tests in the 1950s and 1960s are estimated to have released even greater amounts of radiation. It is estimated that 2.4 million people currently living will die due to cancers caused by radioactivity generated by nuclear testing. The genetic damage created by nuclear tests has killed, and will kill many innocent people. Accidents can also occur, as in the United States when an accident in 1954 saw inhabitants of towns near a test site blanketed in the radioactive plume. Such horrors cannot be allowed to continue, but would be all the more likely in poorer countries trying to test weapons. Furthermore, nuclear testing has done untold damage to the environment and ecosystems around the world. In the Pacific, for example, hydrogen bomb testing destroyed whole ecologies. Even when tested underground nuclear weapons are dangerous to the environment, with radiation seeping out of test sites at half of all such tests2. It is imperative that the environmentally devastating effects of these weapons not be allowed to continue through testing.1 Costandina, Titus. 2001.

New York: Monthly Review Press.
Counterpoint:Every country has a right to self-defense, which includes access to a nuclear deterrent. If advanced countries are concerned about nuclear testing they could provide the technology to budding nuclear powers so that they can be safer in their construction and testing of nuclear weapons. Furthermore, the damage supposedly caused by nuclear fallout is not so great as to deny the fundamental right to self-defense. Some ecosystems may be damaged and some areas may suffer higher radiation levels, but it will not be so bad as to significantly reduce the quality of life of people within the countries conducting nuclear tests or that of their neighbours.
Point:A ban on nuclear testing is almost universally desired in virtually every country, with the exception of a few rogue states, such as North Korea. Even in the United States, which has been reticent to sign, the popular opinion is overwhelmingly in favor of the ban1. There is a very strong political impetus to enact a ban, and actually doing so would show that the international community could actually agree upon something. It is difficult to make the case that international cooperation will accomplish anything regarding contentious issues when it cannot even act on one that has universal support virtually everywhere. A ratification of the ban could thus restore faith in the ability of the international community to accomplish important goals.1 Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. 2011. "Key Reasons for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty". Available: [11]
Counterpoint:The vast majority of people may support a ban, but that will not stop rogue states from developing and testing nuclear weapons any more than signing the CTBT will. The ban might gain praise from people around the world, but the actual effect to how countries behave would be minimal. Furthermore, there is a potential harm in signing the treaty, in that people might actually believe that the ratification of CTBT accomplished something, and would suppose that countries seeking nuclear weapons would actually be deterred from doing so. This could dampen political will to stand up to these states directly, a dangerous possibility if those rogue states do not stop their programs.
